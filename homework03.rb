=begin 
Write a program that asks for your favorite Crayola crayon and then takes the string and yells it back in all caps and in reverse.

Write a program that asks for your mood for the day, then returns the length of the string. Then return the string with 'meow' prepended to it.

Write a program that takes two numbers from the user and shows the sum, difference, product and quotient of the two numbers.

Write a program that asks for a sentence. Then ask for their favorite word in that sentence. Then tell them what index that word starts at. See the Ruby Docs page for String for a handy method to use. 

Write a program that asks for the cost of your dinner at a restaurant. The program will return back to you a tip of 18% of your meal cost. Make sure the tip is always returned with two decimal places.

Write a program that accepts your age. Convert your age to how old you are in seconds. Convert your age to how old you would be on the 8 different planets (hint: search planet rotation conversion rates). Output what your age in years would be on each planet.

Create a Mad Libs program with at least 10 inputs and a minimum of one each of these: verb, plural noun, adjective, preposition, geographical feature, object, number.

On the evening before Christmas, Santa Claus was at the North Pole preparing his lovely deers. 
Nine they were but only one had a bright nose to guide the sleigh quickly through the night.
All the presents laid secure in the back seat and Santa was ready to go.
With Christmas ahead he flew through time to gift all good children around the world.
