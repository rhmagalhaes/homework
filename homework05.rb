Help match up teams for the first round of a seed-based tournament. 
In a seeded tournament, and during the first round, the top seed is matched with the bottom seed, 
the 2nd highest team is matched with the second lowest, etc.  

Example:

Seeds
1. Wisconsin
2. Michigan
3. Michigan State
4. Indiana

Matchups:
(1) Wisconsin versus (4) Indiana,
(2) Michigan versus (3) Michigan State 

Create the first round matches for a tournament using seeds.

Your program should include a menu, where you can enter teams, and then seed them.  

Example: 

Welcome to My Tournament Generator. Enter a selection:
1. Enter teams
2. List teams
3. List matchups
0. Exit program


Your program should check for the following: 

1. If an odd number of teams are entered, the top-seeded team gets a bye (doesn't play)

Example:

Seeds
1. Wisconsin
2. Michigan
3. Michigan State
4. Indiana
5. Purdue

Matchups: 
(1) Wisconsin has a bye
(2) Michigan versus (5) Purdue
(3) Michigan State versus (4) Indiana

Hints:
You should utilize Classes (probably just one).
Make sure you can do multiple match-ups (that is, match up once, then come back and match-up again).

Extra practice:

A gym has hired you to solve a problem. Most of their clients are fairly new to weightlifting and don’t know what to put on the barbell for a particular weight. 
The weights they have made available are in 45, 35, 25, 15, 10 and 5 lbs. increments. 
Build them a Ruby application that will tell them, for a given weight, what plates to put on each side of the bar. 
Bear in mind that the bar itself weighs 45 lbs.
For example, if they want to load 225 lbs. on the bar, they will need to put two 45 lbs. plates on each side of the bar. 
45x4 = 180 lbs. Plus 45 lbs. for the barbell itself equals a total of 225 lbs. 

Hint: You don't really need to create Objects for this one, so you get a break from that. But you will need to create methods!



300
300 - 45 = 255
255/45 = 5 & 30
4 & 75
75/35 = 2 & 5
0 & 75
75/25 = 3 & 0
2 & 25
25/15 = 1 & 10
0 & 25
25/10 = 2 & 5
2 & 5
5/5 = 1 & 0
>> add 5 or lose 5
